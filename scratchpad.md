# AI Feed Consolidator - Development Scratchpad

## Current Phase
- ✅ Migrated from Google OAuth to Firebase Authentication
- Testing main features of the application
- ✅ Improved authentication flow with React Router
- ✅ Fixed authentication flow and CORS issues

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Update environment files with Firebase configuration
2. ✅ Install Firebase dependencies (firebase and firebase-admin)
3. ✅ Create Firebase client-side services:
   - ✅ Firebase configuration (src/firebase/config.ts)
   - ✅ Firebase authentication service (src/firebase/auth.ts)
4. ✅ Create Firebase server-side services:
   - ✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialization (src/server/auth/firebase-admin.ts)
   - ✅ Authentication middleware (src/server/auth/middleware.ts)
   - ✅ Authentication routes (src/server/routes/auth.ts)
5. ✅ Update client-side components:
   - ✅ AuthProvider component (src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx)
   - ✅ Login component (src/components/auth/Login.tsx)
   - ✅ App component (src/App.tsx)
6. ✅ Sync environment files and add Firebase mock for testing:
   - ✅ Update .env.test with Firebase Admin SDK configuration
   - ✅ Create mock Firebase service account for testing
   - ✅ Update .env.example with all necessary variables
7. ✅ Improve authentication flow with React Router:
   - ✅ Add React Router for navigation
   - ✅ Create protected routes for authenticated content
   - ✅ Redirect authenticated users from login page to dashboard
   - ✅ Hide server verification error for unauthenticated users
8. ✅ Fix authentication flow and CORS issues:
   - ✅ Update CORS configuration to use specific client URL
   - ✅ Switch to popup authentication with redirect fallback
   - ✅ Add isRedirecting state for better user feedback
   - ✅ Enhance error handling and logging
   - ✅ Fix database service issues in authentication middleware
   - ✅ Improve state management for redirects
   - ✅ Create dedicated verifyAuth function for server-side verification
9. ✅ Test the Firebase authentication implementation:
   - ✅ Test user sign-in with Google
   - ✅ Test token verification with the server
   - ✅ Test user sign-out
10. Fix any remaining issues that arise during testing
11. Update documentation with Firebase authentication details

## Progress
- Updated environment files (.env.example and .env.test) with Firebase configuration
- Installed Firebase dependencies (firebase and firebase-admin)
- Created Firebase client-side services:
  - Firebase configuration (src/firebase/config.ts)
  - Firebase authentication service (src/firebase/auth.ts)
- Created Firebase server-side services:
  - Firebase Admin SDK initialization (src/server/auth/firebase-admin.ts)
  - Authentication middleware (src/server/auth/middleware.ts)
  - Authentication routes (src/server/routes/auth.ts)
- Updated client-side components:
  - AuthProvider component (src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx)
  - Login component (src/components/auth/Login.tsx)
  - App component (src/App.tsx)
- Synchronized environment files:
  - Updated .env.test with Firebase Admin SDK configuration
  - Created mock Firebase service account for testing
  - Updated .env.example with all necessary variables including Google OAuth
- Improved authentication flow with React Router:
  - Added React Router for navigation
  - Created protected routes for authenticated content
  - Implemented redirect for authenticated users from login page to dashboard
  - Fixed server verification error display for unauthenticated users
  - Added health check endpoint to server
- Fixed authentication flow and CORS issues:
  - Updated CORS configuration to use specific client URL instead of wildcard
  - Switched to popup authentication with redirect fallback for better reliability
  - Added isRedirecting state to improve user feedback during authentication
  - Enhanced error handling and logging in authentication flow
  - Improved logging for better debugging
  - Fixed database service issues in authentication middleware
  - Added fallback for database service in firebaseAuth middleware
  - Explicitly registered 'db' service in service container
  - Improved redirect handling in AuthProvider
  - Enhanced user feedback during authentication process
  - Created dedicated verifyAuth function for server-side verification
  - Added X-Requested-With header for CORS compatibility
  - Improved token verification with better error handling
  - Successfully tested the authentication flow with popup method

## Unfinished Tasks
- Examine tests for redundancy and improve test performance
- Address React Query warnings
- Fix login history recording error (currently showing "Failed to record login" in logs)
- Update documentation with Firebase authentication details

## Testing Plan
- ✅ Test user authentication flow with Firebase:
  - ✅ Sign in with Google
  - ✅ Verify token with server
  - ✅ Access protected routes
  - ✅ Sign out
- Test feed management:
  - Add feed
  - Delete feed
  - Update feed
  - Refresh feed
- Test feed display:
  - View feed items
  - Filter feed items
  - Sort feed items

## Notes
- All tests are passing, but there are warnings related to React Query that need to be addressed
- Make sure to use the correct database names:
  - Development: ai-feed-dev
  - Test: ai-feed-test
- Firebase authentication implementation is complete and working successfully
- There's a non-critical error in login history recording that should be fixed
- The popup authentication method is more reliable than redirect, with fallback to redirect if popup is blocked
