  - Development: ai-feed-dev
  - Test: ai-feed-test

- Git Security:
  - All sensitive information has been purged from Git history
  - Used git-filter-repo for complete cleanup
  - .env file properly excluded from tracking

- Testing:
  - All tests currently passing
  - Some React Query warnings remain to be addressed
  - Database connection pooling optimized for tests

- API Documentation:
  - Complete API reference available in docs/api-reference.md
  - Authentication endpoints: /api/auth/*
  - Feed endpoints: /api/feeds/*
  - Feed item endpoints: /api/feed-items/*
