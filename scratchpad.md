   - ✅ Test user sign-out
10. ✅ Clean up Git repository of sensitive information
    - ✅ Remove .env file from Git tracking
    - ✅ Purge sensitive credentials from Git history
    - ✅ Replace real credentials with placeholders
    - ✅ Ensure .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files
11. ✅ Fix login history recording error
    - ✅ Added missing created_at and updated_at fields to SQL query
    - ✅ Properly registered LoginHistoryService in service container
    - ✅ Enhanced error logging for better debugging
12. ✅ Improve test coverage for login recording functionality
    - ✅ Added tests for recordFailedAttempt method
    - ✅ Created tests for both with and without user ID scenarios
    - ✅ Verified all test cases pass successfully
13. Fix any remaining issues that arise during testing
14. Update documentation with Firebase authentication details

## Progress
- Updated environment files (.env.example and .env.test) with Firebase configuration
- Installed Firebase dependencies (firebase and firebase-admin)
- Created Firebase client-side services:
  - Firebase configuration (src/firebase/config.ts)
  - Firebase authentication service (src/firebase/auth.ts)
- Created Firebase server-side services:
  - Firebase Admin SDK initialization (src/server/auth/firebase-admin.ts)
  - Authentication middleware (src/server/auth/middleware.ts)
  - Authentication routes (src/server/routes/auth.ts)
- Updated client-side components:
  - AuthProvider component (src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx)
  - Login component (src/components/auth/Login.tsx)
  - App component (src/App.tsx)
- Synchronized environment files:
  - Updated .env.test with Firebase Admin SDK configuration
  - Created mock Firebase service account for testing
  - Updated .env.example with all necessary variables including Google OAuth
- Improved authentication flow with React Router:
  - Added React Router for navigation
  - Created protected routes for authenticated content
  - Implemented redirect for authenticated users from login page to dashboard
  - Fixed server verification error display for unauthenticated users
  - Added health check endpoint to server
- Fixed authentication flow and CORS issues:
  - Updated CORS configuration to use specific client URL instead of wildcard
  - Switched to popup authentication with redirect fallback for better reliability
  - Added isRedirecting state to improve user feedback during authentication
  - Enhanced error handling and logging in authentication flow
  - Improved logging for better debugging
  - Fixed database service issues in authentication middleware
  - Added fallback for database service in firebaseAuth middleware
  - Explicitly registered 'db' service in service container
  - Improved redirect handling in AuthProvider
  - Enhanced user feedback during authentication process
  - Created dedicated verifyAuth function for server-side verification
  - Added X-Requested-With header for CORS compatibility
  - Improved token verification with better error handling
  - Successfully tested the authentication flow with popup method
- Cleaned up Git repository to remove sensitive information:
  - Used git-filter-repo to completely remove the .env file from Git history
  - Replaced all sensitive credentials (API keys, client IDs, secrets) with placeholder values
  - Ensured .env file is properly excluded in .gitignore
  - Verified that GitHub no longer detects secrets in the repository
  - Maintained original .env file for local development while removing it from Git tracking
  - Created a fresh, clean history on the main branch with no sensitive data
- Fixed login history recording error:
  - Identified that LoginHistoryService was initialized but not registered with container
  - Added proper registration in app.ts
  - Fixed missing created_at and updated_at fields in recordFailedAttempt SQL query
  - Added enhanced error logging for better debugging
  - Verified fix by observing "Login recorded successfully" messages in logs
- Improved test coverage for login history functionality:
  - Added two new test cases for the recordFailedAttempt method
  - Created test for recording failed login attempt without a user ID
  - Created test for recording failed login attempt with a user ID
  - Verified all assertion checks pass
  - Confirmed proper database recording in both scenarios
  - Ran tests successfully with all 4 test cases passing

## Unfinished Tasks
- Examine tests for redundancy and improve test performance
- Address React Query warnings
- ✅ Fix login history recording error (currently showing "Failed to record login" in logs)
- ✅ Add test coverage for LoginHistoryService.recordFailedAttempt
- Update documentation with Firebase authentication details
- Consider rotating credentials that were previously exposed in Git history

## Testing Plan
- ✅ Test user authentication flow with Firebase:
  - ✅ Sign in with Google
  - ✅ Verify token with server
  - ✅ Access protected routes
  - ✅ Sign out
- Test feed management:
  - Add feed
  - Delete feed
  - Update feed
  - Refresh feed
- Test feed display:
  - View feed items
  - Filter feed items
  - Sort feed items

## Notes
- All tests are passing, but there are warnings related to React Query that need to be addressed
- Make sure to use the correct database names:
  - Development: ai-feed-dev
  - Test: ai-feed-test
- Firebase authentication implementation is complete and working successfully
- ✅ Fixed login history recording error that was causing "Failed to record login" messages
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage for LoginHistoryService, including recordFailedAttempt method
- The popup authentication method is more reliable than redirect, with fallback to redirect if popup is blocked
- Successfully cleaned the Git repository of sensitive information using git-filter-repo
- Learned that .env files committed before .gitignore was set up will continue to be tracked
- Used git-filter-repo instead of BFG Repo-Cleaner for more complete cleanup
- Created a fresh history approach with old branches preserved as backups
- Techniques used: clone with --no-local, pattern-based text replacement, and path filtering
