# AI Feed Consolidator - Development Scratchpad

## Current Phase
- ðŸ”„ Testing and finalizing core functionality
- ðŸ”„ Preparing for feed management implementation

## Current Tasks
1. Address React Query warnings in the client application
2. âœ… Update documentation with Firebase authentication details
3. Examine tests for redundancy and improve test performance
4. Consider rotating credentials that were previously exposed in Git history
5. Implement feed management testing
6. Document where the API paths are so the AI can easily find/access them in the future.
7. Fix linter errors in deprecated auth.ts middleware file related to config.google property

## Recently Completed
- âœ… Updated all documentation to reflect Firebase Authentication
  - Updated `.cursorrules` with Firebase environment variables
  - Removed Google OAuth dependencies from package.json
  - Added deprecation notices to legacy authentication files
  - Updated CHANGELOG.md with Firebase Authentication migration details
  - Verified README.md correctly references Firebase Authentication
  - Verified auth routes are properly using Firebase Authentication
  - Updated package-lock.json by running npm install
- Fixed login history recording and authentication flow
- Migrated from Google OAuth to Firebase Authentication
- Cleaned Git repository of sensitive information
- Added test coverage for login history functions

## Testing Plan
1. âœ… User Authentication (Complete)

2. ðŸ”„ Feed Management
   - Add feed
   - Delete feed
   - Update feed
   - Refresh feed

3. ðŸ”„ Feed Display
   - View feed items
   - Filter feed items
   - Sort feed items

## Technical Notes
- Firebase Authentication:
  - Popup authentication method is more reliable than redirect
  - Using Firebase Admin SDK for server-side verification
  - LoginHistoryService now properly records authentication attempts

- Database Configuration:
  - Development: ai-feed-dev
  - Test: ai-feed-test

- Git Security:
  - All sensitive information has been purged from Git history
  - Used git-filter-repo for complete cleanup
  - .env file properly excluded from tracking

- Testing:
  - All tests currently passing
  - Some React Query warnings remain to be addressed
  - Database connection pooling optimized for tests

## Next Features (After Current Tasks)
1. Feed integration implementations:
   - RSS/Atom feed integration
   - YouTube integration
   - Twitter/X integration

2. Content summarization:
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Two-level summary system
   - Value assessment algorithm

3. Unified interface:
   - Topic-based content grouping
   - Read/unread status tracking
   - Priority scoring system
