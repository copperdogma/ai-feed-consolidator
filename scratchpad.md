# AI Feed Consolidator - Development Scratchpad

## Current Phase
- âœ… Addressed feed polling errors in the running application
- âœ… Fixed issue with app trying to fetch feeds when none exist
- âœ… Fixed TypeError in FeedPoller.checkIfFeedsExist method
- âœ… Verified all tests pass with the updated implementation
- âœ… Confirmed application runs without errors when no feeds exist
- ðŸš§ Testing main features of the application

## Next Steps
- Test main features of the application now that all tests are passing
- Document any additional issues found during testing
- Address React Query warnings about updates not wrapped in `act()`
- Examine last massive commit to see if refactoring is needed
- Document where the application API routes are so it's easy for AI to find in the future
- Add feeds to the database and test the feed polling functionality with actual feeds

## Unfinished Tasks
- Examine tests + test framework see if we need to refactor. I suspect there was a lot of redundancy/inefficiency.
- Address React Query warnings about updates not wrapped in `act()`
  - Warning appears in `useFeeds.test.ts` tests
  - Need to refactor the React Query hook tests to use `renderHook` with proper `act()` wrapping
- Improve test performance for faster execution
- Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
- Consider implementing integration tests that verify complete user flows

## Issues or Blockers
- âœ… Feed polling errors in the running application:
  ```
  [ERROR: Error fetching feeds
      whereClause: "WHERE is_active = true
          AND (
            last_fetched_at IS NULL
            OR last_fetched_at < NOW() - (COALESCE(fetch_interval_minutes, 60) || ' minutes')::interval
          )
          AND (
            NOT EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 FROM feed_health
              WHERE feed_health.feed_config_id = feed_configs.id
              AND feed_health.is_permanently_invalid = true
            )
          )"
      params: []
      error: {}
  ```
  - âœ… Issue resolved by rebuilding the databases and running migrations properly
  - âœ… The `feed_health` table was missing from the database, causing the SQL query to fail
  - âœ… Created fresh databases and ran migrations to ensure all tables were created correctly

- âœ… App tries to fetch feeds on startup even when none exist:
  - The feed polling job starts immediately when the application starts
  - It attempts to fetch feeds due for update even when the database is empty
  - This causes unnecessary error logs and potential performance issues
  - âœ… Added a `checkIfFeedsExist` method to the `FeedPoller` class that queries the database directly
  - âœ… Modified the `pollFeeds` method to check if feeds exist before attempting to fetch them
  - âœ… Created comprehensive tests for the new method to ensure it works correctly
  - âœ… All tests are now passing, including the new tests for the `FeedPoller` class

- âœ… TypeError in FeedPoller.checkIfFeedsExist method:
  - The method was trying to access a property of undefined when processing the query result
  - Fixed by:
    - Updating the SQL query to use `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM feed_configs LIMIT 1`
    - Adding proper error handling and result parsing
    - Implementing a more robust approach to extract the count value regardless of column name
    - Adding debug logging to help diagnose similar issues in the future
    - Updating tests to match the new implementation
  - All tests now pass, including the new test case for handling different PostgreSQL column name formats
  - Verified that the application now starts without errors and properly handles the case when no feeds exist

## Testing Plan
1. âœ… Fix application startup issues
2. âœ… Verify server starts correctly with new pg-promise implementation
3. âœ… Fix failing tests WITHOUT breaking server functionality
4. âœ… Investigate feed polling errors in the running application
5. âœ… Fix issue with app trying to fetch feeds when none exist
6. âœ… Fix TypeError in FeedPoller.checkIfFeedsExist method
7. âœ… Verify all tests pass with the updated implementation
8. âœ… Confirm application runs without errors when no feeds exist
9. ðŸš§ Test user authentication flow
10. ðŸš§ Test feed management (add, edit, delete feeds)
11. ðŸš§ Test feed display and filtering
12. ðŸš§ Test content fetching from various platforms
13. ðŸš§ Test summary generation
14. ðŸš§ Test user preferences and settings

## Notes
- The server is now running successfully with all required database tables
- All tests are now passing (254 total tests, including 169 server tests and 85 client tests)
- React Query tests have warnings about updates not wrapped in `act()` that should be addressed
- Database migration issue resolved by rebuilding databases and running migrations properly
- Important to use the correct database names: `ai-feed-dev` for development and `ai-feed-test` for testing
- Added robust error handling to the feed polling process to prevent unnecessary errors when no feeds exist
- Fixed the FeedPoller.checkIfFeedsExist method to properly handle PostgreSQL query results
- Improved the test suite to cover different PostgreSQL column name formats and edge cases
- Verified that the application now starts without errors and properly handles the case when no feeds exist
- When running the application with `npm run dev | cat`, the command doesn't return because it's running in the foreground
- The application logs show that the feed polling system is working correctly:
  - It properly checks if feeds exist in the database
  - It skips feed polling when no feeds exist
  - It logs appropriate messages without errors
- Next step is to add feeds to the database and test the feed polling functionality with actual feeds

## Lessons Learned
- PostgreSQL returns column names in different formats depending on the query (e.g., 'count', 'count(*)')
- Always check for null/undefined values when processing database query results
- Add debug logging to help diagnose issues in production
- Use proper error handling throughout the application
- When running long-running processes in the terminal, consider using background processes or separate terminal windows
- Always verify application behavior by checking logs, not just by running tests
