# AI Feed Consolidator - Development Scratchpad

## Current Phase
- Migrating from Google OAuth to Firebase Authentication
- Testing main features of the application

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Update environment files with Firebase configuration
2. ✅ Install Firebase dependencies (firebase and firebase-admin)
3. ✅ Create Firebase client-side services:
   - ✅ Firebase configuration (src/firebase/config.ts)
   - ✅ Firebase authentication service (src/firebase/auth.ts)
4. ✅ Create Firebase server-side services:
   - ✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialization (src/server/auth/firebase-admin.ts)
   - ✅ Authentication middleware (src/server/auth/middleware.ts)
   - ✅ Authentication routes (src/server/routes/auth.ts)
5. ✅ Update client-side components:
   - ✅ AuthProvider component (src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx)
   - ✅ Login component (src/components/auth/Login.tsx)
   - ✅ App component (src/App.tsx)
6. Test the Firebase authentication implementation:
   - Test user sign-in with Google
   - Test token verification with the server
   - Test user sign-out
7. Fix any issues that arise during testing
8. Update documentation with Firebase authentication details

## Progress
- Updated environment files (.env.example and .env.test) with Firebase configuration
- Installed Firebase dependencies (firebase and firebase-admin)
- Created Firebase client-side services:
  - Firebase configuration (src/firebase/config.ts)
  - Firebase authentication service (src/firebase/auth.ts)
- Created Firebase server-side services:
  - Firebase Admin SDK initialization (src/server/auth/firebase-admin.ts)
  - Authentication middleware (src/server/auth/middleware.ts)
  - Authentication routes (src/server/routes/auth.ts)
- Updated client-side components:
  - AuthProvider component (src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx)
  - Login component (src/components/auth/Login.tsx)
  - App component (src/App.tsx)

## Unfinished Tasks
- Examine tests for redundancy and improve test performance
- Address React Query warnings
- Test the Firebase authentication implementation
- Update documentation with Firebase authentication details

## Testing Plan
- Test user authentication flow with Firebase:
  - Sign in with Google
  - Verify token with server
  - Access protected routes
  - Sign out
- Test feed management:
  - Add feed
  - Delete feed
  - Update feed
  - Refresh feed
- Test feed display:
  - View feed items
  - Filter feed items
  - Sort feed items

## Notes
- All tests are passing, but there are warnings related to React Query that need to be addressed
- Make sure to use the correct database names:
  - Development: ai-feed-dev
  - Test: ai-feed-test
- Firebase authentication implementation is complete but needs testing
