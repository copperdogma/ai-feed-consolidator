# Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists and is your external memory, used to help you stay on track.

**Read [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) now.**

Do not update it before you read it. It may have instructions that override what you are about to do.

Update it whenever you:
- Start a new task or phase (edit "Current Phase" and "Next Steps").
- Finish an action (log in "Recent Actions," move to "Completed Tasks").
- Hit an issue (add to "Issues or Blockers").
- Make a decision (note in "Decisions Made").

Keep it concise (<300 lines): summarize or remove outdated info regularly to prevent overloading the context. Focus on the current phase and immediate next steps.
