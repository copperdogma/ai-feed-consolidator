Scientists at MIT have engineered a novel chemical reactor that dramatically improves the efficiency of hydrogen production. The reactor uses a new catalyst material that reduces the energy required for water splitting by 40%. This breakthrough could make green hydrogen production economically viable for large-scale industrial applications. The team's research, published in Nature, demonstrates that the reactor can operate continuously for over 1000 hours without degradation in performance.
