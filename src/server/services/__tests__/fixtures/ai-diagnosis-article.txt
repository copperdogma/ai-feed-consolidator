A groundbreaking study published in Nature Medicine demonstrates how artificial intelligence can assist in medical diagnosis. The research team developed a deep learning model trained on over 1 million medical images, achieving diagnostic accuracy comparable to experienced radiologists. The model excelled particularly in detecting early-stage cancers and rare conditions that human doctors sometimes miss. However, the researchers emphasize that AI should complement, not replace, human medical expertise. The system's decision-making process remains partially opaque, raising important questions about accountability and the need for human oversight in medical AI applications.
