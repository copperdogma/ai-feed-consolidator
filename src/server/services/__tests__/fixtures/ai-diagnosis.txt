Researchers have developed a new AI system that can diagnose cancer with unprecedented accuracy. The system, trained on millions of medical images, can detect early signs of various types of cancer that human doctors might miss. In clinical trials, the AI achieved a 95% accuracy rate, significantly higher than traditional diagnostic methods. The technology could revolutionize cancer screening by making it faster, more accessible, and more reliable, particularly in regions with limited access to specialist doctors.
